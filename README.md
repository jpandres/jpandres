# Who Am I? ðŸ‘‹

I am a developer. I have over 20 years of experience working in Distributed Systems fulfilling different roles such as Software Engineer, Tech Lead and Solutions Architect. I am a Java dev at core, so in addition to shaping/leading teams and working on the high-level vision, I enjoy delivering functionalities and optimising systems.

At the moment I am working for **[Santander PagoNxt](https://www.pagonxt.com/)** in the **Global Payments Hub** project as a Principal Engineer.
In the past I worked as consultant for [AND Digital](https://and.digital/), [VASSIT](http://www.vassit.co.uk/) and [IBM UY](https://www.ibm.com/uy-es)

When not working I enjoy practicing Taekwon-Do ITF, boxing and playing guitar.
